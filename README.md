# Linear Regression

This project uses **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks** to implement and practice key concepts in **linear regression**. 

It is part of the **Mathematics 101 module** from the **KeepCoding Full-Stack Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp**, specifically within the **algebra-calculus-geometry** unit.

This problem sets focuses on one of the most fundamental topics in machine learning: **linear regression**.

## **Contents**

This project includes two main parts:

1. **Linear Regression with Least Squares**:
   - Implementing the matrix form of linear regression using the least squares method to calculate the optimal coefficients for linear regression models.
   - Understanding the mathematical foundation and applying it programmatically.	

2. **Optimization with Gradient Descent**:
   - Implementing gradient descent to optimize linear regression models.
   - Exploring the relationship between learning rate, convergence, and performance.
